		 	<h2> Our Mission </h2>
			<section>
			<p>Fashion Forward is a sustainable organization dedicated to helping the environment
			and our society by upcycling clothing. We take old, damaged, or unwanted garments and 
			transform them into new, stylish and cheap creations: shirts, dresses, pants, jackets, 
			head accessories, bags and more. During this reuse, renew, and recyle process, 
			our team utilizes a unique zero-waste production process. Through our biannual fashion 
			shows and informative blog posts, we hope to educate our clients and society about the 
			impacts of the fashion world and what we can do to address the damage that results.

			<h2> Why Are We Doing This? </h2>
			<h3> The Shocking Stats </h3>
			The fashion industry is suffocating our Earth. 
				<ul>
					<li> After oil, the clothing and textile industry is the world's largest polluter </li>
					<li> These two industries produce: </li>
						<ul>
							<li> 20% of global waste water </li>
							<li> 10% of total global emissions (1.2 billion tones of greenhouse gas) </li>
							<li> 24% of insecticides and 11% of pesticides from cotton farming </li>
						</ul>
					<li> Chemical dyes can pollute waterways, killing fish and other aquatic creatures 
					due to high levels of lead, mercury and arsenic </li>
					<li> Synthetic fabrics such as polyester can shed plastic microfibers that make their way into
					drinking water and the seafood eaten by people </li>
					<br>
					<li> Over 400 billion square meters of fabric is produced per year. 15% of that number
					is discarded during the cutting process, never to be used. In total,
					one year's fabric cutting waste is enough to envelop both Switzerland
					and Wales </li>
					<li> Nearly 235 million items of clothing end up in landfills each year </li>
					<li> According to Stephanie Benedetto, CEO of Queen of Raw, "by 2025, two-thirds of the entire world's 
					population will face shortages of fresh water and be exposed to hazardous chemicals from textile 
					production alone. Yet we keep making more clothing that end up being discarded after a few uses </li>
					<br>
					<h3> It's time to take action </h3>
